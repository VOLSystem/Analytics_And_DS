Note:
* Studio System defines a “female lead” as a woman who is listed first in official press materials, and this is in keeping with the listings on IMDb, with lead actors getting the first named credit slot.
* Bechdel Test: http://bechdeltest.com/ To pass a film must “1. [H]ave at least two [named] women in it 2. Who talk to each other 3. About something besides a man.”

Some of the observed variance from [shift7's original analysis](https://shift7.com/media-research) is expected—aside from the choice to use the top 20 films annually over a decade—because of the use of top grossing films 
regardless of country of origin. The original analysis only utilized U.S. films, likely because Bechdel Test information was available for all of them.
Some foreign-made films did have this information available and where available it was included.</br></br>

As entertainment is a fast-moving area, the inclusion of a narrow range for the shift7 data was valid in showcasing recent trends. 
That said, this also means that a few outliers can influence the data strongly. The ROI chart shows that returns for female-led films were noticeably larger
for 2013-15. As those include the biggest box office takes, they likely affected shift7’s findings to a measurable degree despite using a total of 350 films 
from 2014-2017. While shift7’s team found a major trend for films with a female lead to outperform those with a male lead in their chosen range, over the
longer window of 2010-2019 the performance was more balanced. Both female and male-led films performed about the same, with each having above a 6:1 
ROI over the range, though female-led films were slightly ahead.</br></br>

The trend of films that passed the Bechdel Test performing better than those that didn’t appears to be noticeable for the $50-100M budget range
and very prevalent for the $100M+ range in both data sets. This is in keeping not only with shift7’s findings but also others that have observed
quantifiably better performance/audience ratings for films with an involved gender-diverse cast. Though not analyzed here, it’s worth mentioning
that similar analysis has also found films with identifiably diverse casts based on other attributes also tended to perform or be rated better.</br></br>

There is discussion on the Bechdel Test site about some major movies that failed the test, such as *Spider-Man: Far from Home*, *Pirates of the Caribbean: 
On Strange Tides*, and Marvel’s *The Avengers*. While those arguments could be said to technically lean the other way in favor of passing depending 
on perspective, it is interesting that they hinge in all three cases on whether not a single pair of women are identified and have a conversation
about something besides a man. It’s not necessary to argue that films can’t be focused in heavily on male or female characters and still perform well,
but it does appear from these and other analysis results to be expected that a wider audience may have difficulty relating to the roles and relationships on 
screen in those cases. About twice as many films passed the test as didn’t based on the available data.</br></br>

As in some time periods female-led films have performed better, and over longer periods they have performed at least on par with male-led films, 
a discrepancy in top, mean, and median salaries for female and male lead actors is not justified by the returns seen at the box office. 
All things being equal, the data make it reasonable to expect high-quality actors to bring in good box office numbers regardless of gender, 
so there’s no reason pay shouldn’t be commiserate with performance. This is not to be non-inclusive of those who identify as other than male or female
but is what can be pulled based on available data. If an actor’s films have performed well, their past performance and relevance should be reflected in 
their compensation.</br></br>

With the statements in mind, it remains a complex conversation to determine what puts two actors on par with one another. The only way to accurately show that there’s a 
true difference in the pay between two actors would be for all factors to be controlled for, or be the same, aside from the variable being studied, i.e., gender. 
As shown in [this article](https://www.fastcompany.com/90446804/discrimination-plays-a-role-in-hollywood-salaries-and-women-lose) from 2019, defining the
variables that demarcate a top performer can be difficult.</br></br>

A test for significance of both the mean ROI for budget dollars and mean global box office dollars—p-values 0.8107 and 0.9441 respectively—indicates
that there is likely no statistically significant difference in the box office returns/dollars for male and female leads. A test for significance of Bechdel 
Status—p-value 0.0080—indicates that there is likely a statistically significant difference in mean box office returns for films that pass the Bechdel
Test versus those that don’t. A p-value of 0.1432 indicates that there is likely no statistically significant difference in mean ROI of box office
to budget dollars between the two groups studied.</br></br>

All of this taken into account, given that films with female actors in the lead role tended to generate a slightly higher return on investment and,
during the period studied for Top 20 films, showed average returns of $739M vs $743M for their male counterparts, the data suggests a reasonable expectation
that the ability to garner box office dollars is likely equal between genders. Where actors of both genders perform similarly, it stands to reason they
should earn similar pay. While it is difficult to define what makes two actors otherwise the same, evidence would suggest pay scales should be more in
keeping with what is seen when looking at the [controlled pay gap](https://www.payscale.com/research-and-insights/gender-pay-gap/) across all industries
within a reasonable margin of error. It also appears reasonable that writers & directors may want to consider consider the less-than-onerous facets of 
the Bechdel Test when creating and adapting screenplays as it does appear to have a strong relationship to total box office outcomes.
